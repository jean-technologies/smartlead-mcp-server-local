# Smartlead MCP Managed Service - Feature Branch

This branch (`feature/managed-service-platform`) contains the implementation plan and initial code for transforming the Smartlead MCP Server into a fully-managed service platform. This enables non-technical users to easily deploy, configure, and manage MCP instances in both Standard and SSE modes simultaneously.

## What's Implemented

1. **Documentation**:
   - [Architecture Overview](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - High-level system design
   - [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md) - Implementation details and workflow
   - [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md) - Hosting options and recommendations
   - [User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md) - End-user documentation (to be completed)
   - [API Reference](./API_REFERENCE.md) - API specifications (to be completed)

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Unified configuration (`src/config/unified-config.ts`)
   - Support for both environment variables and config files
   - Multi-mode support within a single instance

3. **Docker Setup**:
   - Development Docker Compose file (`docker/docker-compose.yml`)
   - Container definitions for each component
   - Multi-container architecture

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Core Framework Enhancement**:
   - Implement `TransportManager` for multiple transports
   - Create separate transport modules:
     - `src/transports/stdio.ts`
     - `src/transports/sse.ts`
   - Refactor server initialization in `src/index.ts`

2. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Create React application skeleton
   - Implement basic UI components
   - Set up authentication flow

3. **Service Core Implementation**:
   - Create Express API server
   - Implement database schema and models
   - Build RESTful API endpoints

4. **Instance Manager**:
   - Implement Docker orchestration
   - Create instance lifecycle management
   - Set up monitoring and logging

## Getting Started

1. Check out this branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/managed-service-platform
```

2. Review the documentation in the `docs/managed-service` directory

3. Set up the development environment:
```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p managed-service/dashboard
mkdir -p managed-service/service-core
mkdir -p managed-service/instance-manager
mkdir -p docker/base
mkdir -p docker/dashboard
mkdir -p docker/service-core
mkdir -p docker/instance-manager

# Start the development environment
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Hosting Recommendations

For a simple yet scalable managed service, we recommend:

1. **For Individual Users/Small Teams**:
   - Digital Ocean App Platform ($30-40/month)
   - Simple deployment with minimal DevOps knowledge

2. **For Growing Businesses**:
   - AWS ECS with Fargate ($100-180/month)
   - Serverless container platform with good scalability

3. **For Enterprise Scale**:
   - Kubernetes on GKE ($300-550/month)
   - Best-in-class scalability and management features

See [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed hosting options and instructions.
